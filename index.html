        <h3><a href="#intro" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h3>
        <p>You're here because you know me or you would like to get to know me. Hi there! My name is Albert and I am currently living and working in the beautiful city of Chicago. I love exploring cities and college campuses, and besides Chicago, have spent considerable time in Hong Kong, Toronto, and Atlanta. I am both a Northwestern and Georgia Tech alum, but my heart is still with the Wildcats.</p> 

        <h3><a href="#web-apps" class="anchor"></a>Web Applications</h3>
        <p>I enjoy creating open-source web applications. Lately, my toolkit has mostly been AngularJS and Rails, with MongoDB or PostgreSQL database. With AngularJS, integration with MongoDB is seamless through the MEAN stack. Rails and Postgres work well together especially with Heroku applications, so that's also been a recent focus of mine. I hope to eventually explore Ember.js and Python/Django, and I'm intrigued by Julia as a potential competitor to Python and R, as well as Swift, the future of iOS development.</p>

        <h3><a href="#interests" class="anchor"></a>Interests</h3>
        <p>Did I mention I have a lot of interests? I adore the Chicago dining scene - Au Cheval, Union Sushi + Barbeque Bar, and hopefully one day, Alinea and Next. I can solve a Rubik's Cube in 45 seconds, and one day, I will find time to work on F2L. Also, are you a Boglehead too? Then talk to me about investing. But hey, I invest in volatile tech stocks too!</p>

        <p>Sports. I grew up with baseball all my life, even when I lived in Hong Kong, when I was probably one of MLBAM's first heavy MLB.TV users in the early-2000s. I love being a spectator of sports and reading about sports. Just look at my library: dozens of baseball books, and several basketball and football books. I've also been to dozens of Northwestern football games, including most of the Big Ten schools. I still remember celebrating with Corey Wootton (one of my favorite Wildcats of all time) at Ryan Field after we beat Wisconsin in 2009.</p>

        <h3><a href="#projects" class="anchor"></a>Projects</h3>
        <p>Sports has always been my way of building my technical skills and exploring databases and data visualization, whether it's with heatmaps at FanGraphs or building Rails apps. And so naturally, sports has been my way of breaking into the software development industry. Ask me about PITCHf/x or shot charts of NBA or NCAA men's basketball play-by-play data, or let me know how if you would like to collaborate on scraping and parsing play-by-play data sources. Find me on GitHub.</p>
        
        <h3><a name="contact" class="anchor" href="#contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contact</h3>

        <p>It's pretty easy to contact me. Email me at <a href="mailto:albert.yb.lyu@gmail.com">albert.yb.lyu@gmail.com</a> or just shoot me a tweet. I'm always up for talking about the baseball industry or about sports data and visualization ventures and initiatives. Check my GitHub profile if you want to contribute to a project that I'm working on. There's plenty of undiscovered deeloper opportunities in sports, and I'd be interested in talking with you about them!</p>
