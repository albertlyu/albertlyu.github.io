        <h4><a href="#intro" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h4>
        <p>You're here because you know me or you would like to get to know me. Hi there! My name is Albert and I am currently living and working in the beautiful city of Chicago. I love exploring cities and college campuses, and besides Chicago, have spent considerable time in Hong Kong, Toronto, and Atlanta. I am both a Northwestern and Georgia Tech alum, but my heart is still with the Wildcats.</p> 

        <h4><a href="#web-apps" class="anchor"></a>Web Applications</h4>
        <p>I enjoy creating open-source web applications. Lately, my toolkit has mostly been AngularJS and Rails, with a MongoDB or PostgreSQL database. With AngularJS, integration with MongoDB is seamless through the MEAN stack. Rails and Postgres work well together especially with Heroku applications, so that's also been a recent focus of mine.</p> 

        <p>I hope to eventually explore Ember.js and Python/Django frameworks. I'm intrigued by Julia as a potential competitor to Python and R, as well as Swift, the future of iOS development. Chicago is great because developers get together for Meetups all the time. If you would like to check out one of these Meetups with me, let me know!</p>

        <h4><a href="#interests" class="anchor"></a>Interests</h4>
        <p>Did I mention I have a lot of interests? I adore the Chicago dining scene - <a href="http://auchevalchicago.com/">Au Cheval</a>, <a href="http://www.eatatunion.com/">Union Sushi + Barbeque Bar</a>, and hopefully one day, <a href="http://website.alinearestaurant.com/site/">Alinea</a> and <a href="https://www.nextrestaurant.com/">Next</a>. I can solve a Rubik's Cube in 45 seconds, and one day, I will find time to work on improving my F2L time. Are you a Boglehead too? Then talk to me about investing and Roth IRAs. But hey, I invest in volatile tech stocks too!</p>

        <p>Sports. Oh how I love sports. I grew up with baseball all my life, even when I lived in Hong Kong, when I was probably one of MLBAM's first heavy MLB.TV users in the early-2000s. I also love reading about sports. Just look at my library: dozens of baseball books, and several basketball and football books. One of my favorites is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Branch-Rickey-Baseballs-Ferocious-Gentleman/dp/0803224532">Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman</a> by Lee Lowenfish. Branch Rickey is my favorite sports figure of all time, with Marvin Miller being second.</p>

        <p>I've also been to dozens of Northwestern football games, including NU games at most of the Big Ten schools. One of my best college memories was our 17-10 victory over the Iowa Hawkeyes at Kinnick Stadium in November 2009. And I still remember celebrating with one of my favorite Wildcats of all time, Corey Wootton, after we beat Wisconsin two weeks later. The 2010 Outback Bowl remains the most heartbreaking sporting event I have ever attended in person.</p>

        <h4><a href="#projects" class="anchor"></a>Projects</h4>
        <p>Sports has always helped me build my technical skills and explore databases and data visualization, whether it's with heatmaps at FanGraphs or building Rails apps. So naturally, sports has been my way of breaking into the software development industry. Ask me about PITCHf/x or shot charts of NBA or NCAA men's basketball play-by-play data, or let me know how if you would like to collaborate on scraping and parsing play-by-play data sources. <a href="https://github.com/albertlyu">Find me on GitHub</a>.</p>
        
        <h4><a name="contact" class="anchor" href="#contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contact</h4>

        <p>It's pretty easy to contact me. Email me at <a href="mailto:albert.yb.lyu@gmail.com">albert.yb.lyu@gmail.com</a> or just shoot me a tweet. I'm always up for talking about the baseball industry or about sports data and visualization ventures and initiatives. Check my GitHub profile if you want to contribute to a project that I'm working on. There's plenty of undiscovered developer opportunities in sports, and I'd be interested in talking with you about them!</p>
