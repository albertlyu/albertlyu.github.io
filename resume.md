### Projects

* **Shot Charts 3.0**
	<a href=http://shot-charts.herokuapp.com/ class=not-printed>shot-charts.herokuapp.com</a>
	A Rails application that provides statistics and shot chart visualizations for college basketball players. It is supported by a PostgreSQL database, deployed on Heroku's servers, and monitored by New Relic for optimizing application performance. The data is scraped with Python, while the charts are built with Highcharts and heatmap.js.

* **BaseballMod.com**
	<a href=http://www.baseballmod.com/ class=not-printed>baseballmod.com (down)</a>
	AngularJS web application for quickly and visually searching and faceting MLB atbat and pitch data for any batter or pitcher. Built on the MEAN stack, it uses the MongoDB database created and maintained by Ryan Kruse's atbat-mongodb project. The responsive design makes this application ideal for desktops, tablets or phones.

* **Chicago Restauranteur**
	<a href=http://chicago-foodie.herokuapp.com/ class=not-printed>chicago-foodie.herokuapp.com</a>
	A Rails application demonstrating the usage of a scaffold for Chicago fine dining restaurants. The end user can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) restaurants, updating the PostgreSQL database. Each restaurant's page connects to the Google Maps API to show their location within Chicago, as well as nearby restaurants sorted by distance.
